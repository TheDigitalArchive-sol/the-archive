# The Digital Archive (POC)

**The Digital Archive** is a decentralized platform aimed at revolutionizing how books are published and stored. By leveraging **Solana blockchain** technology, this project will store books in a secure, immutable, and transparent way, ensuring that authors, artists, and contributors are compensated fairly through a transparent royalty system.
The Digital Archive acts as the publisher, bringing books to life in the blockchain era.

## Project Overview

**The Digital Archive** serves as a blockchain-powered publishing platform that aims to store books in a decentralized and immutable manner. The project ensures that books are securely stored on the **Solana blockchain**, with each part of the book treated as a separate digital asset.

The book is divided into three key parts:
1. **Cover (NFT):** The book cover is tokenized as an NFT to ensure authenticity and uniqueness.
2. **Text (Chapters):** The body of the book is divided into chapters, where each chapter is securely stored and traceable on the blockchain.
3. **Back of the Book:** A section listing all contributors to the book, including authors, artists, and editors, ensuring transparency/royalty and recognition.

Additionally, a **royalty system** based on Solana smart contracts is integrated to ensure that every contributor is fairly compensated. All transactions and royalties will be public and secure.
